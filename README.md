# -ISA-Adaptive-Storage-Medieval-Module

Update of the original mod from Soul and Bbradson with some addons to increase compatibility to my mod series [ISA]          

# Ideas for possible next updates

- Look for how the building are displayed in the architect menu and add a drop down menu for each type if needed (idk if one for each type of building or just 3 big one divided in wood/stone/metallic)
